# 👋 Hi, I’m Collins Bett

I'm a curious technologist currently navigating my journey from **Geospatial Information Science** into the dynamic world of **Cloud Security and Cybersecurity**.

With roots in mapping the physical world and a growing passion for securing the digital one, I’m building bridges between data, infrastructure, and secure systems — one terminal and tool at a time.

## 🔐 Current Focus
- Cybersecurity fundamentals (networking, threat modeling, SOC)
- Cloud platforms (Azure, AWS) and their security layers
- Security labs via [CyberShujaa](https://www.cybershujaa.co.ke), in partnership with **Microsoft**
- Hands-on GitHub projects to cement skills

## 🧭 My Background
I studied **Geospatial Information Science**, gaining experience in spatial analysis, QGIS, Python scripting, and fieldwork. But I found myself increasingly drawn to automation, secure systems, and how to protect the digital side of spatial technologies.

## ✨ Why This Site?
This portfolio is where I:
- Share what I’m learning (wins and mistakes)
- Document my projects
- Reflect on switching careers and staying motivated

## 🧠 Outside Tech
When I’m not debugging something or studying logs, you might find me:
- Reading about tech ethics or digital rights
- Doodling ideas for future side-projects
- Mentoring peers making similar transitions
