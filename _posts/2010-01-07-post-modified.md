For a long time, my world revolved around maps, spatial data, and understanding the Earth's surface using GIS technologies. But as the digital landscape evolved, I realized something critical: **the systems powering our maps, sensors, and spatial tools are just as important as the data itself — and they must be secure.**

That’s when I started seriously exploring **cybersecurity**.

## 🧭 The Pivot: Why Cybersecurity?

As our work in geospatial science moves to the cloud, the risk of data breaches, system outages, and cyber threats grows. I saw the need to **protect geospatial systems**, especially those used in government, agriculture, and infrastructure. This led me to look for structured training — and that’s when I found **LMS Cybershujaa**.

## 🤝 Cybershujaa x Microsoft: A Powerful Partnership

I'm currently a participant in the **Cybershujaa Skilling Program**, a collaboration between **LMS (Learning Management Systems)** and **Microsoft**. The program aims to equip young professionals in Kenya with **industry-ready cybersecurity skills**, ranging from:

- Network and cloud security fundamentals
- Threat intelligence and mitigation
- Microsoft Defender, Azure Security Center, and more

What I appreciate about the program is its hands-on approach. We’re not just watching videos — we’re doing real labs and simulations using **Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure**.

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

Some of the key takeaways so far:

- The basics of **identity and access management (IAM)** — crucial for managing users and resources securely in the cloud.
- How to interpret and respond to **security alerts** in Microsoft Sentinel.
- Setting up **NSGs (Network Security Groups)** in Azure to protect virtual machines.
-- The value of combining GIS + Cloud + Security as a unique skill set in today’s job market.

The program is **intensive and requires real commitment**, but that’s what makes the learning so impactful. It’s shaping not just my skills — but my mindset.

## 🚀 Looking Ahead

My goal is to blend my **geospatial background** with new skills in **cloud computing and cybersecurity** to build secure, intelligent spatial solutions. Whether it's monitoring natural disasters, protecting drone networks, or building smarter infrastructure maps, security will always be a core layer.

This blog will document that journey — the lessons, the failures, and the breakthroughs. If you’re a fellow GIS student thinking about your next step, or someone curious about cybersecurity, I hope you'll follow along.
