Switching from GIS to cybersecurity hasn't been a walk in the park — it's more like hiking uphill while learning to read a new map.

At first, I was constantly second-guessing myself. *"Am I cut out for this?"* *"Will I ever catch up with others who’ve been in tech longer?"* Imposter syndrome creeps in, especially when you’re surrounded by seasoned professionals and you're still trying to figure out ports vs. protocols.

What’s kept me going?

## 🎯 Community and Structure
**Cybershujaa**, a Microsoft-supported initiative, gave me more than just content — it gave me community. Knowing I’m learning alongside others in Kenya who are just as curious (and just as overwhelmed) has been empowering. The structure of the LMS and hands-on labs with virtual machines made progress feel real.

## 🧠 Mindset: Progress over Perfection
I’ve learned not to compare my beginning to someone else's middle. Each GitHub project, every completed lab, and every new cybersecurity concept is a step forward. Small wins count.

## 🛠️ What Helps Me Stay on Track
- Posting small wins on **LinkedIn** (they add up and attract support!)
- Pushing code or notes to **GitHub**, even if they’re simple
- Blocking 1–2 hours daily for focused study — even if I don’t feel 100%

## 💬 Final Thought
Yes, it’s demanding. But it’s also deeply rewarding. The biggest shift has been realizing that **you don’t need to know everything — just keep showing up**.
