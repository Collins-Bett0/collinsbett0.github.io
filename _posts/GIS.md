# When Everyone Is a GIS Expert: Escaping the Click-to-Map Trap

*By someone who studied GIS from 1.1 *

I studied GIS from day one.

While others added it later as a certificate or a Master's topping to their degrees in sociology, planning, or engineering — I chose it as my foundation. I learned spatial statistics, projections, scripting, remote sensing, cartography, and everything in between.

I thought I was entering a high-value, technical profession.

I was wrong.

## GIS Is Everywhere — But That’s the Problem

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is one of the most widely applicable skillsets today. It touches agriculture, health, climate, disaster response, business, logistics, infrastructure, and more.

But here’s the paradox: **when something can be applied everywhere, it often belongs to no one.**

In Kenya — and many other developing countries — GIS has become a buzzword.  
Surveyors say they do GIS.  
Planners say they do GIS.  
NGOs want GIS officers who can run ArcMap and make a dashboard.  
And hiring managers often can’t tell the difference between someone who completed a GIS minor and someone who spent 4 years doing spatial data science full time.

> *What I learned in four years, someone else can now claim after a weekend YouTube binge or a single semester add-on.*

And just like that, a profession becomes a checkbox.

## The Esri Effect

Let’s talk about the elephant in the room: the **“click-to-map” culture**.

Esri, in its mission to make GIS accessible, has created tools that make it almost too easy. ArcGIS Online. StoryMaps. Dashboards. You can drag and drop your way into what looks like a sophisticated spatial product — with zero real understanding of projections, data quality, or geoprocessing logic.

Now, don’t get me wrong — democratizing GIS is a good thing for the world.  
But for people who studied it deeply, it has created an awkward reality:

> The more user-friendly GIS becomes, the harder it is to stand out as someone who actually knows what they're doing.

When skill becomes invisible, it becomes undervalued.

## The Surveying License Gate

Another twist in this story is how tightly GIS is tied to surveying and geomatics — especially in developing markets. And while GIS and surveying are related, they are not the same.

But in countries like Kenya, surveying is a **regulated profession**. You need to be licensed.  
If you’re not, you’re just an assistant — regardless of how advanced your GNSS, LiDAR, or drone processing skills are.

So even if you’re technically better at spatial analysis or data integration, you're locked out of the "serious" land jobs unless you hold that license. Meanwhile, those who do can wave a "GIS" flag with minimal depth, and still get the high-paying contracts.

It's frustrating. It’s real. And it’s not sustainable.

## GIS Alone Is No Longer a Career

This is my conclusion after months of trying to land work in the field:

> GIS, as we knew it, is no longer enough.

Unless you pair it with:  
- A domain (e.g., health, climate, planning, agriculture), **or**  
- A technical edge (e.g., coding, automation, remote systems),

…you’re just another map maker. And there are too many of us.

## A Word to Fellow GIS Graduates

If you’ve been feeling what I’ve been feeling — that creeping sense that your hard-earned degree doesn’t feel as solid anymore — you’re not alone.

And you’re not wrong.

But don’t abandon GIS. **Outgrow it.**  
Evolve beyond dashboards and static maps. Learn to code. Integrate systems. Pair your spatial knowledge with automation, AI, hardware, or policy.

Because the future of GIS isn’t in drag-and-drop.  
It’s in **autonomous drones**, **real-time sensors**, **global-scale analytics**, and **embedded intelligence**.

## Final Thoughts

I still believe GIS is powerful. But power without control is chaos. And right now, the GIS space is chaotic — crowded, noisy, and full of people clicking buttons without understanding the data underneath.

So if you studied GIS deeply and feel overlooked…  
If you feel like you’re in a career trap…  
If you feel like you’ve been shouting into the void…

You’re not bitter.  
You’re ahead.

> *GIS isn’t dying — it’s evolving. The only question is: are you evolving with it, or being replaced by it?*

### Let’s Connect

I’m documenting my journey as a GIS graduate navigating this new reality, and I’d love to hear from others who’ve felt the same — especially from underrepresented regions.

Let’s build the future of GIS — before someone else defines it for us.
