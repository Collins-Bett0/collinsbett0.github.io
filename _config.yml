# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  bio    : "I'm a curious and hands-on technologist exploring the intersection of cloud computing and cybersecurity. I started in geospatial technology, where I learned how data shapes the real world. Now, I'm building skills to secure digital systems and deploy scalable cloud infrastructure.

           Currently diving deep into Microsoft Azure, AWS, Microsoft Defender, and Linux, I'm also learning tools like Terraform, Kali Linux, and SIEM systems. I hold the SC-900 certification and am preparing for the AZ-104 exam to solidify my cloud admin capabilities.

             Whether it's writing secure infrastructure as code, managing identities, or building cloud-native apps, Iâ€™m excited about using tech to solve real-world problems. My goal? To help organizations stay secure, resilient, and cloud-ready"
